Yet another Todoist app.
Or some sort of helper tool thingy.

1. Things floating through my head right now are a minimal, HabitRPG-esque dashboard that tracks streaks, bonuses, daily "quests", weeklies, and any other sort of gamification to encourage a) putting tasks into the system and b) using the system. Could make suggestions to tasks like "hey this task has been overdue for 3 months. Can it be broken down into smaller tasks?" or "Does this task really need to be done?". "Does it align with your interests, long-term goals, or is it a responsibility?"

2. Another idea is a node-based (a la Obsidian graph view) GUI method of organizing or visualizing your tasks. You could drag and drop between nodes to show relationships. Sub-tasks, dependent tasks. Could do Gantt charts.

3. ‚≠ê Could also create Todoist tasks based off of checklists I make in Obsidian notes.This would help me make sure I don't lose track of tasks.

So, any could be a cool idea, but it's best to do what's most useful for me. Whatever I'm going to get use out of.
